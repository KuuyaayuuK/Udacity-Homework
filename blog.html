            <h1>Internet Financial System: Infinity Exchange And Beyond</h1>
            <p>April 23, 2023, Chris Burniske</p>

            <hr>

            <p>For anyone that’s spent enough time studying blockchains, it’s clear these transparent,
                auto-accounting, and programmatic systems are superior to the siloed, rusty towers of traditional finance.
                Once the tech is understood, it becomes obvious that blockchains will undergird our digital lives,
                which explains why in the midst of the ‘wild west of crypto,’ we see every major bank, tech giant,
                and nation-state developing their own blockchain-adjacent systems.
            </p>
            

            <p>That said, for blockchains to reach their full potential, we need more and better front-ends that
                are approachable not only by those at the frontier of innovation, but that surpass the user experience,
                safety, and compliance standards demanded by the largest institutions in the world. Using finance as an example,
                consider that retail trading makes up less than a quarter of the total volume in US equity markets (see graph below),
                hile retail’s share in the much larger fixed income markets has historically stayed well below 5%.

            </center></small></p>

            

            <p>Therefore, using traditional markets as our reference point, we’re constraining the total crypto-market size
                by at least 10x by not making blockchain-based systems accessible to institutions. As long as these systems
                remain open and permissionless, all market participants would have access to the same assets, pricing, and tools,
                whereas today retail is largely locked out of ‘institutional finance.’ Everyone wins: institutions get exposure
                to an exciting new growth vertical of the global economy, accelerating maturation therein; retail gets access
                to products that were previously out of reach; and crypto-natives get the scale they’ve always dreamed of. 
            </p>

            <p>One way in which we expect this trend to manifest, is a transition from Decentralized Finance (DeFi), to the
                 Internet Financial System (IFS). DeFi came about as a rallying cry for the earliest experiments of finance
                  on blockchains, a time when the defiance was necessary to prove out the promise. As these systems mature,
                   the defiant components will rightfully persist, but we expect them to be complemented by compliant systems
                    that invite the largest pools of global capital to utilize open networks.
            </p>

            <p>A<i> brief aside on interest rates and yield curves</i></p>

            <p>At the heart of finance are fixed income assets, which are <u>several times larger than equities in total value</u>,
                 and at the heart of fixed income assets are interest rates. Interest rates are arguably the single most 
                 important variable for financial markets as a whole, as they put a price on time, and nearly all assets 
                 incorporate time into their pricing. If interest rates are 0.2% vs 20%, our behavior shifts radically
                  between investing in risky assets vs letting cash earn yield in a money-market account, or taking out a
                   mortgage at low rates vs waiting for when “time” is cheaper.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interest rates can speed up or slow down an economy, affecting all players. Yield curves are illustrations
                of interest rates for different assets across a range of durations. For the IFS to flourish, we need coherent
                yield curves for the major cryptoassets and stablecoins. Coherent yield curves require tight two-sided (borrow/lend)
                pricing across a range of durations, liquidity at those durations, as well as credit risk mitigation through
                overcollateralization and prudent risk management.
            </p>

            <p><i>Introducing Infinity Exchange</i></p>

            <p>To illustrate the delta between what is currently available in DeFi, and what we envision to be the first inning 
                of the IFS, we’ll briefly contrast <u>Aave</u> and<u> Infinity Exchange</u>. Aave is a premier borrow-lend protocol within DeFi,
                boasting some of the largest pools of assets in its category. Most loans on Aave have a variable interest rate, 
                although the platform also facilitates loans with temporarily fixed borrow rates.
            </p>

            <p>Infinity, by comparison, is a rates protocol facilitating lending and borrowing across both floating and fixed rates
                 (with fixed maturity dates). Infinity aims to create yield curves and liquidity for all the major cryptoassets, 
                 marrying the market structures and risk management of TradFi with the transparency of DeFi, all wrapped in a clean,
                 professional interface (see image below).
